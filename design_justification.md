Design Justification:

In the current stage, our game is primarily text-based and can only operate in the terminal. It takes the player approximately over 5 minutes to know the basic operations of the game only by the texts and commands in the terminal. We considered adding a more straightforward graphical interface to operate the game which can shorten the player's ramp up time, but this wasn’t in our current skill set. Additionally, we considered adding more interesting methods and objects to make the Northampton Bingo more playable, however due to time constraints, this was not possible.
