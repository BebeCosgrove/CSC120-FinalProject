Design Justification 
In the current stage, our game is primarily text-based and can only operate in the terminal. It takes the player approximately over 5 minutes to know the basic operations of the game only by the texts and commands in the terminal. We considered adding a more straightforward graphical interface to operate the game which can shorten the player's ramp up time, but this wasnâ€™t in our current skill set. Additionally, we considered adding more interesting methods and objects to make the Northampton Bingo more playable, however due to time constraints, this was not possible.
