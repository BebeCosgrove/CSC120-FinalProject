* **What was your overall approach to tackling this project?**

We firstly draft a narrative of the game so that we can decide what class and method we need to put in our game. Since we did this project in teamwork, it became clear to divide the workload based on different classes/methods. The underlying intention of the game was to apply the concepts we have learnt in the class over the semester, so when we were deciding the methods, we took past assignments as a reference. 

* **What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?**

One of the biggest accomplishments of the game is the application of Guava. Guava helped us to build an indirect map as well as the key of the whole layout of the game. We learnt how to add information (e.g.directions) on the edges and link all the classes and methods together in the Game Loop. 

* **Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?**

We could have implemented the makeResponse() method in the chatbot class a bit differently. Our approach was a bit procedural, and it could have been broken up into several methods for clarity. In a similar vein, we could have also made the instances of Object included in the game attributes of the buildings rather than the map, so that we could have removed some of the error-handling from the chatbot.

* **If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?**

If we had unlimited time to work on this project, we’d love to implement graphics to make the game more interesting to the user. In addition, it would be great to have items sold by restaurants be instances of a class that is different than object, since it would give us more functionality with regards to the methods in the Restaurant class (we chose to just use Store to save time). We also wish we could have implemented a method called lookAround(), which would tell the player which buildings surrounded them. Finally, Northampton has a lot to do, and we could have captured more buildings and objects in our game with more time\!

* **What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?**

We received a lot of really good feedback on this project\! For instance, Professor Mosca advised us to add a class for Tasks, since each task had to hold a lot of information in order to work as implemented, and we found this to be really helpful.

* **If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?**  
  If we could go back in time, we would have given ourselves the hint to give ourselves a lot of time to figure out how Guava works and to not be intimidated by Guava because once you figure it out, it’s not that complicated.  
* ***If you worked with a team:*** **please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.**

Our project consists of different classes. We decided that each individual in the group would be responsible for writing one part of the project (e.g. buildings, person, bingo card, map) and then we could meet to connect the classes and write the game loop. By having something to do both individually and as a group, each person could get a sense of what they should do and have a chance to collaborate with each other. This kind of working strategy made the division of the work and communication within the group much clearer. Overall, the team dynamics made everyone have a good experience on this project.
